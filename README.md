# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Review global death statistics pre-COVID and become more comfortable with Tableau

## Process
Connect to project in Tableau public
Create some graphical data to better familiarize myself with the data
Create questions to answer with relevant charts and comparisons
Set up dashboards and create a Tableau story to present.
Finalize and submit project.

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)
I chose Option 2 and used the 20220327 annual-number-of-deaths-by-cause.csv dataset to analyze the leading cause of 
deaths pre-COVID. Dealing with global issues I thought it relevant to show my information mostly with a global image, as 
well as present the relevant numbers compared to the others with bar graphs and occasional line graphs.
After looking through some of the information I decided to show the leading cause of death and then focus on some events
that showed spikes in deaths, and look for information that would support a "good" statistic (decreased death rate).

## Challenges 
Choosing what to present, and creating visuals that would entice the audience, showing relevant information, while
not showing too much.

## Future Goals
Incorporate more data sets that would include other information like population stats, death by age group, and more
subcategories, like deaths from which animals or specific chemicals.
